# fwd-project

Team project for elective [S23] Front-end Web Development.

## Editor

We used Visual Studio Code as primary editor for project. The following extensions are really helpful: 
- ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- Prettier
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- GitLens
- VS Code Icons
- TODO Highlight
- Import Cost

To enable format on save add the following to your ```settings.json``` file:  
> "editor.formatOnSave": true
